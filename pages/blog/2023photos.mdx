Was inspired to pick up photography this year for the first time by a Korean drama, of all things.

> That’s the thing about cameras. They pretend to be objective observers, but they’re actually the most personal of all.

_Lee Sun-hee, Our Beloved Summer_

The show does a great job of exploring the spaces between and inside people, from three vantage points:

-   First, the characters themselves,
-   Then, at one distance removed, from the perspective of a diegetic documentary filmmaker,
-   And finally, from the perspective of the non-diegetic show-makers themselves.

Thus, it does correspondingly well at slowly exploring themes like trauma, love, time, and how they manifest in the art and architecture we create and inhabit.

> I love permanent, unchanging things
> ... that’s why there is neither people, nor time, in my art.
