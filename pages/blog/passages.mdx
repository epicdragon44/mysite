_Brief sketches of scenes, set to music._

## I.

_Set to Meeting Eddie Smith, by Damien Jurado_

Five shades of parallel metal, twin towering monoliths of grey, and the endless cymbal roll of time. Two taps of the bass drum later and the snare kicks in, counting down towards a Zimmer-like chorus. The buildings are but one shade of grey now. The aspect ratio widens, and the wave looms wide over a teeming audience. In Carnegie Hall, the show never stops. The snare drum taps on and on.

Perhaps it’s a Christopher Nolan movie. We cut scenes at the climax. Nicotine and perfume perforate the nostrils – the snare now mixes with the strum of steel guitar. Out a warehouse window, the Yangtze rolls past, a red carpet stained blue with blood for the celebrities of tomorrow. The machines churn on ~ two great grey sail-masts rise in the distance, bowing under the weight of the boat from which they grow.

Strings hum and vibrate, and muses flit at the fringes of empire. At the foot of the Argonath, a band of musicians have set-up camp under a vast grey bridge over the river which bears their name, weeping into waxed wood for exposure – the kind which one dies from.  Five thousand miles downstream, the Bogatyr gates erode into loose soil, joined at last with the bedrock of Moscow. Mussorgsky’s notes wilt and burn, strangled by Shostakovich’s snare. The snare. The snare taps on and on and on and on.

i – VII – III – VII.

Jay Chou films yellowed frames not far from where Arkhipov froze, mid-decision, suspended in water and time, fingers over fire.

i – VI – III – iv.

Police descend onto the streets of Santiago. The sands of timeless desert and endless time part, and it is revealed that on the ancient Incan stones buried therein are inscribed Latin text and a phoenix with Friedman’s head: crescat scientia; vita excolatur.

i – iv – VI – v.

From geosynchronous heights, one can almost see the cacao beans of the Amazon burn and melt into the Gulf Stream, tickling the continent’s sides and then disappearing into the endless vortices of the North Atlantic, doomed to forever watch bomber jets ply paths overhead that would be familiar to any American slaveowner.

i – iv – v – i.

The snare sputters to a halt. Leningrad is free, but still Shostakovich’s Seventh soldiers on. What more fitting soundtrack could there be?

## II.

_Set to Ghost, by August Eve_

Cavernous empty dark sky

Rises as side-swept curtains over the great dome atop Manhattan.

Black piano and chronograph spin with twinkling gold foil keys on hollow wood frame.

In my mind,

A square window into space.

We dance under an anchor of nectarine crystal-glass swords draped in soft velvet.

Does she miss me?
