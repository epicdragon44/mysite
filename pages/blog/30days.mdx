# 30 Days of Design

I resolved to do a month of daily UI challenges. I'm only displaying the top ~10 here, which I'm reasonably happy with.

    Error 404 pages generally just redirect you to the homepage. But what if it could
    improve your KPIs and be humorous at the same time? Here, I’m imagining a 404
    page for a hypothetical Duolingo or Rosetta Stone-like Chinese Language Learning
    service on the web. It’s a running joke among Chinese learners that it’s incredibly
    hard to write Zero (0) in Chinese. Here, I’m just tapping into that. Some notes:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The calligraphy could be improved (i.e. I would have preferred a
            brush at least 2pts thicker), but I’m no painter and the online
            generators are quite limited.
        </li>
        <li>
            The dotted frame behind the Chinese character, for those not in the
            know, is a mizige, or a training box to help beginners learn how to
            trace their characters. Befitting of a language learning community.
        </li>
        <li>
            The dotted background box also provides a key design motif elsewhere
            - in this case, for the “Go Back Home” button.
        </li>
        <li>
            The background color is rice white. I took a photo of some rice
            under the best lighting conditions I could, and basically picked out
            a hex code from the resulting photo that looked reasonable.
        </li>
        <li>
            The vibe is very contemporary (grotesque, large font, small body
            text, barely noticeable colors). If it was used in a real language
            learning company, it might intimidate users. Here it just works
            because it gives off a minimalist vibe, so I decided to keep it.
        </li>
    </ul>

  <summary>Notes</summary>
  Summer of 2023, I stayed in an apartment in Downtown Austin, splitting the rent with a close friend. We spent at least ten minutes figuring out one annoying wall-mounted remote, and how it controlled the living room lights. <br />
  It turns out that the top-most power button controlled whether power flowed to the entire circuit. From there, we could control the fan speed by tapping the middle button 1, 2, 3 times. On the 4th time, the fan would turn off - independently of the rest of the circuit. <br />
  Similarly, there was a separate “sub-circuit” for the light. Here, there are two separate toggles: the first controlled whether the light was on or off, and the second controlled whether the light was “warm” or “cold”. <br />
  For this design, I figured I would simply redesign this annoying piece of home equipment. <br />

<br />

Changes I made include:

<ul>
    <li>
        The master power button is now more obviously so. I placed it in the top
        right and made it red, intentionally reminiscent of similar controls on
        TV remotes.
    </li>
    <li>
        The fan section is clearly delineated, and shows a range between off and
        high speed. You can skip to any option with one click, instead of
        repeated ones.
    </li>
    <li>
        Since there’s no use in changing the light warmth when the light is off,
        we can reduce cognitive load on the user by turning two toggles into
        three options (i.e. the user won’t have to first turn on the light, and
        then select the color, but rather simply go from off to the desired
        color).
    </li>
</ul>

<br />

Some design constraints:

<ul>
    <li>
        The original design has no text. Early Apple devices were famously
        universally understandable too. I like that design philosophy, and aimed
        to achieve the same.
    </li>
    <li>
        I restricted myself to using only the physical components available on
        the original device: buttons and indicator lights.
    </li>
</ul>

<br />

Some notes:

  <ul>
    <li>
      I added the little “Assembled in...” tag to the bottom for visual balance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ranges are vertical, Option Presets are horizontal.
    </li>
    <li>
      The design of the remote itself, as well as of the lighting options, are “squircles,” since that seems to be trendy on Design Twitter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Since the squircly design lends a certain imposition on the physical curvature of the design (obviously bulges in the middle and tapers unevenly on the edges), I had to design shadows and lines around this. You can assume the light source in the image comes from above and overhead.
    </li>
    <li>
      I made the new remote more matte than the original. I would say this is an unequivocal improvement, except I suppose greasy fingers could stain the new design more easily.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <summary>Notes</summary>A satirical hypothetical design for a world where
    the New York Times launches their own luxury residential apartment line in
    Manhattan. Some notes:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Conformance to the usual “New York Times” look and feel, while
            trying to emphasize the boldness of the business decision that must
            have led to such a decision (simpler, bolder text inputs as just
            underlines, for instance, compared to what the NYT usually uses on
            their sites).
        </li>
        <li>
            Hand-drawn signature doubles as captcha for sign-ups and legally
            binding (satire).
        </li>
        <li>
            Vaguely biting copy (“for our most loyal readers”, “By signing
            below...”).
        </li>
        <li>
            Dual purpose (scroll to see example apartments if you’re on the
            fence). I’m not sure how this would pan out in real life in terms of
            conversions, but if this hypothetical world’s NYT was using sign-ups
            as a KPI, I can’t see how this would be detrimental to KPI as long
            as good representative photos are chosen.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <summary>Notes</summary>A checkout page for my imaginary startup, Sailboat.
    Boring, simple corporate design. The main things of note:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Subtle sailboat shadow in the top right adds a bit more balance to
            the entire upper region.
        </li>
        <li>Using Figma AutoLayout across the entire component.</li>
    </ul>

    Going for something corporate, simple, Silicon Valley-esque. Settled on this
    icon, for a hypothetical startup called Sailboat. The icon is vaguely reminiscent
    of both a Sailboat, and the letter S. Note two things:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inset shadow gives it a sunken appearance that allows the sailboat
            to pop out more.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
            The icon isn’t properly centered, because the center of gravity is a
            little to the lower left to compensate for the top-heavy
            “sail”.{" "}
        </li>
    </ul>
