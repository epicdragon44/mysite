# 30 Days of Design

I'm traditionally a frontend-oriented developer, so I've had my fair share of exposure to UX/UI design. I can also confidently say that INFO 1998: Introduction to Digital Product Design, a course taught by Cornell's AppDev team, is perhaps my favorite class at Cornell. However, before this summer, I never really had the opportunity to create and work on UI design in isolation, with sweeping creative freedom. Cowed, I think, a bit by the immensity of the design process itself, I decided I might as well take an hour a day to create some simple designs and practice my hand at the craft again. Thus, I signed up for the Daily UI challenge, and -- with about a month left in the summer -- began.

What follows is a collection of my amateur work.

## Day 1: Splash Hint

I've had a bit of an obsession with Brutalism lately. From an architectural point of view, it's a functional style suited for a post-war world: a democratic and open-source architecture where public funds manifest themselves in the intentionally and exaggeratedly visible public usage of a building.

Over the summer of 2023, I lived in a set of apartments to the west of the University of Texas at Austin -- a public state-funded school well-suited for brutalism. The picture I used is of a UT Austin Library. I conceptualized it as a dead simple sign-up page for tours of key brutalist buildings in Austin.

There is, of course, the neo-Brutalist movement in web design as well. Since it goes hand in hand with the architectural movement, I tried my hand at it here. Neo-Brutalist websites often use a mixture of white sheets and large, bold text lines of the Grotesque font family, underscored by page-wide "underline" bars. I used the open-source Anderson Grotesk font here, and two sheets of semitransparent white to create a sliding concrete effect. Upon clicking the CTA, the sheets slide upward, making what was previously an underline act as a sort of navigation bar separator for the next page.

I left the next page blank, to be used for corporate sign-up purposes. Additionally, the motion design is a bit rough, but I think it gets the point across.

All in all, a dead simple first design that probably took about 20 minutes. Hopefully I'll get better at this as time goes on.
