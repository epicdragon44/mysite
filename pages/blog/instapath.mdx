# Working at Instapath (YC W19)

August 2023 marks the end of a 16-month journey at Instapath for me. During my time there, I designed and built the entire frontend for the Luciviewer, a web-based image viewer for pathology scans that can render multi-gigabyte images at different zoom levels with dynamic resolutions and optimal performance, while allowing the user to attach AI-generated annotations, recolor, group, sort, organize, filter, and search at scale.
