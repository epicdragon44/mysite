### Hi! I'm Daniel Wei.

I'm a student at Cornell University studying Computer Science, with minors in UX Design and East Asian Studies. I've been programming for about 7 years, and designing for about 4.

I'm a design engineer. That means I do all things user-facing: from UI/UX design to front-end development. I believe in:

-   Obsessing the details.
-   Functional programming for frontends that scale.
-   Honest, self-guiding, brutalist, flat, intuitive design.
-   The power of explicit, idealistic, top-down design systems.

I've been in the tech start-up scene since 2019, as a high school founder at <CustomLink href="https://leangap.org" text="Leangap" />. I've since worked in various front-end facing roles at <CustomLink href='https://www.ycombinator.com/' text='Y-Combinator' />, <CustomLink href='https://www.joinef.com/' text='Entrepreneur-First' />, <CustomLink href='https://neo.com/' text='Neo' />, and <CustomLink href='https://youtu.be/fa9-T6Fie4U' text='Mark Cuban' />-backed start-ups. I've co-paneled talks with <CustomLink href="https://bobatalks.com" text="BobaTalks" /> and Cornell APAA. I'm a <CustomLink href='https://neo.com/scholars' text='Neo Scholar Finalist' />.

On campus, I'm currently a Project Manager for <CustomLink href="https://www.designconsultingcornell.com/" text="Design Consulting at Cornell" />. I was also the Lead of Development on our campus&apos; largest software engineering team, <CustomLink href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" text="Cornell DTI" />, for about a year.

Outside of work: I'm trying to learn landscape and urban photography. I do some casual writing, occasionally centered on themes from Chinese and Asian Diasporic history. I'm collecting ghosts on <CustomLink href='https://www.are.na/daniel-wei/ghosts-tsnifcgude4' text='Are.na' />.

I'm passionate about start-ups that push the limits of what collaborative networks humans can do together, at the intersection of design and technology.
