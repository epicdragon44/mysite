# about

Hi! I'm Daniel. I'm a student at Cornell University studying Computer Science, with minors in UX Design (Information Science) and East Asian Studies. I've been coding for about 7 years, and designing for about 4.

I'm a design engineer. That means I do all things user-facing: from human-centered UI/UX design, to the implementation of the front-end code that powers it.

---

Code-wise: I write clean, efficient, pixel-perfect, performant front-ends. I have a deep understanding of state management and web development fundamentals. I use a strongly functional-programming-informed approach to creating codebases that scale. I obsess the details.

Design-wise: I strive for clean, self-guiding, flat interfaces. I'm influenced by a childhood stooped in Tongji Univ. architecture and civil engineering booklets (my parents' alma mater). I aim to design honestly and brutalistically. I believe in the power of explicit, idealistic design systems.

I've been in the tech start-up scene since 2019, as a high school founder at <CustomLink href="https://leangap.org" text="Leangap" />. I've since worked in various front-end facing roles at <CustomLink href='https://www.ycombinator.com/' text='Y-Combinator' />, <CustomLink href='https://www.joinef.com/' text='Entrepreneur-First' />, <CustomLink href='https://neo.com/' text='Neo' />, and <CustomLink href='https://youtu.be/fa9-T6Fie4U' text='Mark Cuban' />-backed start-ups. I've co-paneled talks with <CustomLink href="https://bobatalks.com" text="BobaTalks" /> and Cornell APAA. I'm a Neo Scholar Finalist.

On campus, I'm currently a Project Manager for <CustomLink href="https://www.designconsultingcornell.com/" text="Design Consulting at Cornell" />. I was also the Lead of Development on our campus&apos; largest software engineering team, <CustomLink href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" text="Cornell DTI" />, for about a year.

Outside of work: I'm trying to learn landscape and urban photography. I do some casual writing. I'm collecting ghosts on <CustomLink href='https://www.are.na/daniel-wei/ghosts-tsnifcgude4' text='Are.na' />.

I'm passionate about start-ups that push the limits of what collaborative networks humans can do together, at the intersection of design and technology.
