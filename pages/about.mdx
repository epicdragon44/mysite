### Hi! I'm Daniel Wei.

I'm a student at Cornell University studying Computer Science, with minors in UX Design and East Asian Studies. I've been programming for about 7 years, and designing for about 4.

I'm a design engineer. That means I do all things user-facing: from UI/UX design to front-end development. I believe in:

-   Honest, self-guiding, brutalist design.
-   Functional programming as the key to building front-ends that scale.
-   The power of explicit, idealistic, top-down, infrastructural systems.

I've been in the tech start-up scene since 2019, as a high school founder at <CustomLink href="https://leangap.org" text="Leangap" />. I've since worked in various front-end facing roles at <CustomLink href='https://www.ycombinator.com/' text='Y-Combinator' />, <CustomLink href='https://www.joinef.com/' text='Entrepreneur-First' />, and <CustomLink href='https://youtu.be/fa9-T6Fie4U' text='Mark Cuban' />-backed start-ups. I've co-paneled talks with <CustomLink href="https://bobatalks.com" text="BobaTalks" /> and Cornell APAA. I'm a <CustomLink href='https://neo.com/scholars' text='Neo Scholar Finalist' />. This summer, I'll be working at <CustomLink href='https://www.google.com/' text='Google' /> as a Software Engineering Intern in New York.

On campus, I'm currently a Project Manager for <CustomLink href="https://www.designconsultingcornell.com/" text="Design Consulting at Cornell" />, leading a team to design better user experiences for enterprise clients of <CustomLink href='https://www.textql.com/' text='TextQL' />, a <CustomLink href='https://neo.com/' text='Neo' /> portfolio company. I was also the Lead of Development on our campus&apos; largest software engineering team, <CustomLink href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" text="Cornell DTI" />, for about a year, where I coordinated recruitment, onboarding, and project development efforts across 80 members.

Outside of work: I'm trying to learn landscape and urban photography. I'm working my way through Hemingway's <CustomLink href='https://www.amazon.com/Whom-Bell-Tolls-Ernest-Hemingway/dp/0684803356?crid=1MABS1K1ZSEHJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iH944oBK6zPM7qhG7W4cy3qIHAhzDlYR55T-W9p5Tfj42YseJ04C_LVhsjf7e7QCDYwrVQ3Bn7ctbmKyHFAygys0obmyjpWUSEslMwNEh-xQN1ZySfAJnie3g_T9fcOr50BW90fr1R8B8i1CKQI2SjcPDaSg5c_pt_F6ScU2qdWp24BKc8mybRhstXRU1Kyk63gmbV94b7BxACWhyOFrjSJOhpjGN9Up7QFOcF1GgqY.wuoQ1N0LNlUgyLTNLErEavUKDVjLUB6u7XKedYZon24&dib_tag=se&keywords=for+whom+the+bell+tolls&qid=1709320688&s=books&sprefix=for+whom+the+,stripbooks,125&sr=1-1' text='For Whom the Bells Toll' /> and James C Scott's insightful <CustomLink href='https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Like-State-Condition-Paperbacks-dp-0300246757/dp/0300246757' text='Seeing Like a State' />. I do some casual writing, occasionally centered on themes from Chinese and Asian Diasporic history. I'm collecting ghosts on <CustomLink href='https://www.are.na/daniel-wei/ghosts-tsnifcgude4' text='Are.na' />.

I'm passionate about start-ups that push the limits of what collaborative networks humans can do together, at the intersection of design and technology.
