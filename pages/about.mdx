# about me

![Me](/photos/bay/IMG_0289.jpg)

Hi! I’m a student at <CustomLink href="https://www.cornell.edu/" text="Cornell University" />, studying <CustomLink href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/" text="Computer Science" />, with minors in <CustomLink href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/node/946" text="UX" /> (Information Science) and <CustomLink href="/" text="East Asian Studies" />. I specialize in frontend engineering, design, and entrepreneurship. I've been coding for about 7 years, and messing around in Figma for a little over two.

On campus, I co-led development on our campus’ largest software engineering team, <CustomLink
    href='https://www.cornelldti.org/'
    text='Cornell DTI'
/>, for about a year. I'm also a design consultant for <CustomLink href='https://www.designconsultingcornell.com/' text='Design Consulting at Cornell' />. This summer, I'll be working in New York with <CustomLink href='https://bubble.io/' text='Bubble.io' /> as a Software Engineering Intern.

I was formerly a Product Engineer at <CustomLink
    href='https://www.instapathbio.com/'
    text='Instapath'
/> (YC W19), where I designed and built their entire landing page and scan analysis
platform. At <CustomLink href='https://yoomi.health/' text='Yoomi Health' />, a Cornell startup, I created
AR product experiences that were demoed to <CustomLink
    href='https://youtu.be/fa9-T6Fie4U?t=300'
    text='Mark Cuban'
/> for seed funding. I’m a <CustomLink
    href='https://neo.com/'
    text='Neo Scholar Finalist'
/>, and have co-paneled talks with <CustomLink
    href='https://bobatalks.com/'
    text='BobaTalks'
/> and Cornell APAA.

I’m interested in the future of the web - designing and implementing human-centric,
intersectional products in elegant, functional ways. You can gain more insight into
my background and interests through my work and writings.
