# Upreach

_Skip to the [bottom](#deliverables) for the final deliverables._

In the Fall of 2023, I worked with a small team of students on [Design Consulting @ Cornell](https://www.designconsultingcornell.com/) to re-imagine the email outreach and sales pipeline experience in the age of AI. Our client: [Upreach.ai](https://upreach.ai/), a New York-based startup that uses AI to help salespeople find and reach out to potential customers.

In particular, I worked on redesigning the flow by which one actually writes an email in the age of AI. How do we integrate AI in email-writing in useful, unobtrusive ways?

### User Research

-   **Users do not have faith in AI systems.**

    The vast majority of users want to carefully monitor and vet AI output at every stage.

-   **Unfamiliar users are intimidated by sales language.**

    Upreach's target customer-base include the relatively inexperienced. Our designs must be intuitive for the uninitiated.

### Client Needs

-   **Have two exit points: output a plain-text email template; or actually send the emails en-masse through Upreach.**

    Upreach's business goals included being a flexible tool that fit into existing sales pipelines, regardless of how they were set up.

-   **Prioritize user progression speed over fine-grained accuracy.**

    The final business goal of Upreach is to develop a fully autonomous AI agent. Until we have a full-confidence unmonitored program, we need to prioritize the speed at which a user can get through the flow!

### Resultant Design Insights

-   **Rely on pre-existing mental models where possible.**

    **AI Chats** are now a well-established paradigm of interacting with the capabilities LLMs. With the right prompt, users can work both accurately, and -- most importantly -- quickly; iterating holistically version after version.

    **Templates** are a well-established pattern in the world of mass emails: instead of forcing a user to look through the hundreds of emails they're going to send out and edit each individually, represent them all using one template email with embedded _placeholders_ to represent dynamic content to be filled in later.

-   **Opt-in fine-grained editing.**

    To maximize speed, allow users to choose between continuing with an AI-generated email, or further customizing it in a rich template editor, complete with placeholders. If the latter, make it easy to rejoin the main workflow afterwards.

-   **Enforce Send Transparency.**

    How do we improve user confidence, in order to work towards true unmanned AI systems? Simple: show them the results are perfect.

    When designing, ensure the user gets to see the _exact_ final email that each recipient will be receiving, if emails are sent through the platform. Furthermore, allow for _further_ customization of each indivdiual email on a case-by-case basis, for opt-in full control.

### Solution Spaces

-   **Notion AI-like interface** for innovative, though unfamiliar combined editing & prompting.

-   **Master page design**: integrate reviewing, editing, and sending each individual email directly after generating all of them at once. Potentially confusing, but most 'efficient.'

-   **Step-by-step flow**: AI-chat with clearly defined, though laborious steps for prompting, editing, and sending. But how to incorporate opt-in components?

## Develop & Deliver

As the end of the semester closed in, we developed a working Figma prototype of the step-by-step flow and did user testing with a wide range of potential users, deriving a set of common problems and then going back to the drawing board. A brief summary of our insights:

After the revisions, we were able to successfully showcase a final prototype.
